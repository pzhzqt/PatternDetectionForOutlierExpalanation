A pattern is defined as increasing if for a given fixed attributes

For a given fixed attribute, variable attribute and an aggregate function over a column, a pattern is defined by fitting a model on values of variable attribute as input versus values of aggregate function as output, for each group formed by fixed attribute. A model is either a regression line whose slope determines whether the discovered pattern of output is increasing or decreasing with respect to the input values or 
or

Pattern(fixed, variable, aggregate_value, model, metric)
For each group formed by fixed attribute, a pattern is determined by fitting a model on variable attribute values versus aggregate values. Metric defines the goodness of fit measure for the model.

There are two types of models which can be fit:

For categorical data (where we cannot fit a regression), fit a least dispersion model:
Least dispersion model finds the percentage of standard deviation with respect to mean. (current threshold of 10% for valid patterns)

For fitting a regression:
Try to fit a linear regression for which the goodness pf fit is determined by the score (R squared coefficient of determination).
The slope determines whether the discovered pattern of aggregate values is increasing/decreasing with respect to the variable attribute values.

Local Patterns: Patterns discovered for the groups formed by fixed attributes.
Global Patterns: A summary of how many percentage of groups hold valid patterns. (Greater than 75% concludes the existance of global pattern).
